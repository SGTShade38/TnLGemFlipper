program queries tldb for auction house prices and tells you which gem to buy and combine/dissolve then resell for profit

Run the executable in the zip file after extracting to get the most recent auction house prices on each gem, and receive tips on which ones to buy and to dissolve or combine them to resell for profit.
Try not to run the executable more than once every 30 seconds or tldb may IP ban you for sending too many requests.
